# SynergyAutoLogOff


## **The Problem**

Hackers are criminals who gain unauthorized access to a network and devices, usually with the intent to steal sensitive data, such as financial information or company secrets.

You can protect your computers in many ways like firewalls and antivirus software but also by following best practices for computer use.
Many businesses, especially those operating servers, are “all systems go” all the time.
If you’re not operating a complex internet-based company, however, log off your machine overnight or during long stretches when you’re not working.

Always being on makes your computer a more visible and available target for hackers; logging off breaks the connection a hacker may have established with your network and disrupts any possible mischief.


## **The Solution**

After the request of our clients, we created SynergyAutoLogOff.
